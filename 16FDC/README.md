# 16FDC Disk Controller Card

The 16FDC card includes a disk controller capable of directly selecting up to four drive (which would typically have beeen 8" or 5.25" drives) up to Dual Density/Double Sided (DD/DS) capacity.

It also includes a serial port, a ROM that can contain RDOS, and simple memory bank-select logic that maps out the ROM once Bank 0 RAM (on another card) has been selected. (A reset from the reset switch will map the ROM back in and take the user to BDOS.)

For a while, I worked with the Tandom TM100 5.25" DD/DS drives that were installed in my Cromemco Z-2D.
