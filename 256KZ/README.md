# 256KZ Memory Card
When looking for a spare memory card for my Cromemco Z-2D, I ended up with a 64KZ with a failed voltage regulator. Basically, that seems to have pretty much fried the card (although I still hope to repair it one day). Looking more, several 256KZ cards were up for auction and at prices lower than the 64KZ. Four times the memory (even if I didn't need it for my work with the Z80) at a lower price seemed like a great opportunity and I bought one of the boards.

And then I figured out why they tended to be cheaper...
